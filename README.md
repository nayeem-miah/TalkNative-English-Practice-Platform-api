## 🛡 Security & Best Practices
- **Data Validation:** All incoming request bodies, queries, and params are strictly validated using **Zod** before hitting controllers.
- **Error Handling:** Centralized Global Error Handler catches and formats all exceptions seamlessly.
- **Async Handling:** Wrappers (`catchAsync`) eliminate the need for repetitive try-catch blocks.
- **Database Integrity:** Designed robustly with Prisma ensuring referential integrity and smooth document management via MongoDB.
